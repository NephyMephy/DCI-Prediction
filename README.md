# DCI-Prediction
A machine learning model to predict future Drum Corps International (DCI) scores based on historical data.

## Features

- Predicts DCI scores for a specified corps on a given date
- Uses historical data including season, date, corps name, and previous scores
- Implements data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques
- PLANNED: Clean Easy UI for a simple interface to interact with the prediction algorithm.
    - Current: Easy to Use CLI-based system. 
- Open Class Corps Historical Data from 2014 and onwards can be only be used due to scoring regulations changing

Planned:
Mandarins, Carolina Crown, Bluecoats, Boston Crusaders, Phantom Regiment, and more
